WebSphere versions 8.5.5 (with the correct service packs) and 9 open up support
for the Java 8 SDK in combination with IBM FileNet Content Manager. One of the
major features in the Java 8 SDK is the support for lambda expressions and the
Stream API. This combination leads to more readable and concise code, making simple
things even more simpler.

The Content Engine API of course pre-dates the Java 8 SDK, so out of the box
there is no support for the Stream API. However [this thread on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24511052/how-to-convert-an-iterator-to-a-stream) inspired the creation of a wrapper class.
The wrapper class takes an iterator based collection and converts its into a Stream.
The wrapper class is a type safe solution because it contains a wrapper method for
all the classes in the `com.filenet.api.collection` package.

>Most of the code of the wrapper class is generated taking the `Jace.jar` file as the
input. The code to generate the code is also included, so feel free to
regenerate the code for newer versions of the API.

You can download the wrapper class from [here]((https://gist.github.com/rickx1/5b6e9a2e62261e4a3df3092689002e9a)), and next add it to your project.
For convenience, first do a static import of the `asStream` method from the `CEAPIStreams`
class in your Java class:

```java
import static com.ecmdeveloper.jace.streams.CEAPIStreams.asStream;
```
Next you can write code like this, printing all the names of the documents in a
folder:

```java
Folder folder = Factory.Folder.fetchInstance(os, path, filter);
asStream(folder.get_ContainedDocuments())
  .forEach( document -> System.out.println(document.get_Name()));
```

To show the full potential of this way of writing, consider this iterator based piece of
code:
```java
Iterator<Folder> iterator = folder.get_SubFolders().iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
  Folder subFolder = (Folder) iterator.next();
  if ( !subFolder.getProperties().getBooleanValue("IsHiddenContainer") ) {
    System.out.println(subFolder.get_Name());
  }
}
```
This is perhaps the shortest way you could print out the names of all the subfolders
which are not hidden using the old way.

This piece of code can be rewritten using the Stream API and lambda expressions in the following
way:
```java
Predicate<Folder> isNotHidden =
  subFolder -> !subFolder.getProperties().getBooleanValue("IsHiddenContainer");

asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .filter(isNotHidden)
  .forEach(subFolder -> System.out.println(subFolder.get_Name()));
```
Besides being a little bit shorter, this code also clearly states what it's intentions are:
Get the __subfolders__, __filter__ them with the __isNotHidden__ predicate and next use
the __forEach__ construct to print the name.

The real benefit comes when you want to add some more functionality to the code,
for instance printing the names in alphabetic order.
```java
Predicate<Folder> isNotHidden =
  subFolder -> !subFolder.getProperties().getBooleanValue("IsHiddenContainer");

asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .filter(isNotHidden)
  .map(subFolder -> subFolder.get_Name())
  .sorted()
  .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
```
By using the __map__ function the folder stream is converted to a String stream containing
the folder names and feeding that stream through the __sorted__ function will result
in a sorted stream.

Next, to show off, we can add more syntactical sugar by using the Java 8 method reference
construction. Using this technique the code can be made even more compact:
```java
Predicate<Folder> isNotHidden =
  subFolder -> !subFolder.getProperties().getBooleanValue("IsHiddenContainer");

asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .filter(isNotHidden)
  .map(Folder::get_Name)
  .sorted()
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```
Instead of printing the names, you could also create a new list containing the names using
the __collect__ method:
```java
List<String> names = asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .map(Folder::get_Name)
  .collect(Collectors.toList());
```
The different possibilities to play with this are endless. For instance this code will
sort the folders based on the the creation date of the folder:
```java
Comparator<Folder> byDateCreated =
  (f1, f2) -> f1.get_DateCreated().compareTo( f2.get_DateCreated() );

asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .sorted(byDateCreated)
  .map(Folder::get_Name)
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```
Or even shorter by again using method reference and the build in constructor for comparing things in the `Comparator` class:
```java
asStream(folder.get_SubFolders())
  .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Folder::get_DateCreated ))
  .map(Folder::get_Name)
  .forEach(System.out::println);
```
I hope that this post will motivate you to embrace the Java 8+ features in your
IBM P8 Content Manager projects. The general idea is that you can simplify your
code and take advantage of the new build in functionality. If you get stuck,
then the Internet is full of examples of doing it the "New" way.
